<p>
I'm a <strong>Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer</strong>, fascinated by systems of all kinds: biological, social, technological. How they work, why they fail, how they solve information flow and how we might design better ones.
</p>

<p>
Professionally, that means building software and working with data, mostly around machine learning and complex system modeling - business or elsewhere. The Skills section has a more detailed overview if you are interested in potential collaborations.
</p>
<p>
The rest of this place collects my interests and outputs.
A lot is me talking to myself, trying to understand things better by writing them down. <br />
</p>
<p>
I'd say the main themes are philosophy and ethics, social theory and management of complexity. <br />
Some of it's polished, some of it's exploratory.<br />
Implicitly, it is about how to be a good person. <br />
All of it's honest.

Currently, I'm living in Berlin. If you found your way here and are still reading this, I'd love to hear from you.
