      Hey, nice of you to drop by.
      I'm collecting my various outputs here. 


      Right now my main focus is finding a great team of wonderful, smart people to work with on something important. 
      
      
      Maybe you or someone you know could fit that description? I'd love to hear from you. 
      

      You can visit my [Education & Skills](skills) section to get an idea what I could do for you and your team.


      Otherwise I hope you find what I aggregated here interesting, useful or at least entertaining."

      text: "A short guide what to expect behind the icons and links on the top. This overview will get updated if need be. 

      - The programming sideprojects that I deemed worthy are public on my {{< icon name=\"brands/github\" >}}[**Github**](https://github.com/PPetermeier) page where this pages itself is also hosted.

      - I'm most active on {{< icon name=\"brands/twitter\" >}}[**Twitter**](https://x.com/infornomics), where I aggregate posts according to my outlined interests and occasionally engage with others, hopefully to the benefit of both of us and others.

      - {{< icon name=\"brands/linkedin\" >}}[**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-petermeier-6ba469229) is mainly a platform for professional contacts and more of a communication channel than a public space for me.

      - On my {{< icon name=\"custom/substack\" >}}[**Substack**](https://infornomics.substack.com/) you will find longer discussions about various topics that are on my mind and needed to get pinned down in writing.

      - You can{{< icon name=\"envelope\" >}} <a href=\"mailto:p.petermeier@posteo.de\">contact me directly</a> through my mail adress embedded.

      - My <a href=\"uploads/CV_for_Website.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CV</a> without private information can be downloaded on the last icon, if the [Education & Skills](skills) leaves you wanting for something more formal."
