        ## Introduction 

        Hey, nice of you to drop by.
        I'm collecting my various outputs here. 


        Right now my main focus is finding a great team of wonderful, smart people to work with on something important. 
        
        
        Maybe you or someone you know could fit that description? I'd love to hear from you. 
        

        You can visit my [Education & Skills](/skills) section to get an idea what I could do for you and your team.


        Otherwise I hope you find what I aggregated here interesting, useful or at least entertaining.

          A brief guide what you can expect behind the icons and links at the top of this page. This overview will get updated as needed. 


          -  The programming sideprojects that I consider worthy are publicly available  on my [{{< icon name=\"brands/github\" >}}**Github**](https://github.com/PPetermeier) page where this pages is also hosted.


          - I'm most active on [{{< icon name=\"brands/twitter\" >}}**Twitter**](https://x.com/infornomics), where I aggregate posts according to my outlined interests and occasionally engage with others, hopefully to the benefit of ourselfs and others.


          - [{{< icon name=\"brands/linkedin\" >}}**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-petermeier-6ba469229) is mainly a professional networking platform and of a communication channel than a public space for me.


          - On my [{{< icon name=\"custom/substack\" >}}**Substack**](https://infornomics.substack.com/) you will find longer discussions on various        topics that have been on my mind and needed to be put down in writing.


          - You can [{{< icon name=\"envelope\" >}}contact me directly](mailto:p.petermeier@posteo.de) via my email adress.


          - My [{{< icon name=\"academicons/cv\">}}](uploads/CV_for_Website.pdf) without private information can be downloaded from the last icon, if the [Education & Skills](skills) leaves you wanting something more formal.
