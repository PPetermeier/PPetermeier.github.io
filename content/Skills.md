      title: "What I experienced so far"
      text: |
        I spent a lot of time studying humanities with a focus on philosophy, only to change course and start my B.S. to learn how to build complex things with a clear purpose using software.
        

        This part of my education is not listed here, mainly because I find it difficult to explain what concrete practical skills I have acquired during my time there. 


        At the same time, I'm sure that my experiences have structured many of my cognitive processes and views in a fundamental way, and have made me a much better software engineer, developer, modeller, team member and human being.    


        If you are curious about this side of me, I would encourage you to visit the  <a href="https://infornomics.substack.com/p/about-me" target="_blank">About this place</a>-Section of my substack. How I think about things I find interesting can be seen in the posts themselves. I hope you like it.
