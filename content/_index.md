        ## Introduction 

        Hey, nice of you to drop by.
        I'm collecting my various outputs here. 


        **Right now my main focus is finding a great team of wonderful, smart people to work with on something important.**


        **Maybe you or someone you know could fit that description? I'd love to hear from you.**
        




        You can visit my <a href="/skills"> Education & Skills </a> section to get an idea what I could do for you and your team.


        Otherwise I hope you find what I aggregated here interesting, useful or at least entertaining.
