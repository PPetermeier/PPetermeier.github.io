      Hey, nice of you to drop by.
      I'm collecting my various outputs here. 


      Right now my main focus is finding a great team of wonderful, smart people to work with on something important. 
      
      
      Maybe you or someone you know could fit that description? I'd love to hear from you. 
      

      You can visit my [Education & Skills](/skills) section to get an idea what I could do for you and your team.


      Otherwise I hope you find what I aggregated here interesting, useful or at least entertaining."
