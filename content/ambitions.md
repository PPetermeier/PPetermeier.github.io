      text: " I want to contribute to solutions to hard and important questions of today. 
      

      Some of the most obvious ways to do that are at least to me:

      - Helping us understand more about the world we live in by building software for scientific purposes.

      - Creating new solutions to our pressing problems - better ones if we already had them, or totally new ones if we were lacking them
